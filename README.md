# GIS Project

Welcome to our GIS (Geographic Information System) project. This project is designed to provide a comprehensive solution for managing and visualizing geographic data. Our platform is accessible at [GIS Property](https://gis-property.netlify.app/).

## Features

- **Interactive Maps**: Utilize the `ChennaiMap` component to interact with maps, including zooming and panning functionalities.
- **Layer Management**: With the `LayerControl` component, users can toggle different layers on the map for better data visualization.
- **Feature Addition**: The `AddFeature` component allows users to add new geographic features to the map.
- **Data Management**: Administrators can use the `Admin` component to manage geographic data and user permissions.
- **User Authentication**: The `LoginForm` component provides user authentication to ensure secure access to the platform.
- **Plot Management**: Users can add and edit plot information using the `AddPlot` and `PlotEditForm` components.

## Impact

Our GIS project aims to revolutionize how geographic data is managed and visualized. By providing an intuitive and interactive platform, we empower users to make informed decisions based on accurate and up-to-date geographic information. This project has applications in urban planning, environmental conservation, and property management, among others.
